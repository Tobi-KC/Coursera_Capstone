    "Problem which is tried to be solved:\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem this project aims to tackle is the search for a new neighborhood in case people have to move to a foreign city.\n",
    "To be more specific, this project serves to help people who have to move to a foreign city to find a new neighbourhood that is as similar as possible to the old neighbourhood they have to leave. On top of that, this project tries to identify the most suitable neighborhood for a given set of preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to very different reasons a lot of people have to move homes. The decision process of where to buy a new house or rent an appartement is quite complex. A lot of features have to be taken into consideration, e.g. socio economic factors like unemployment or the income level of the neighborhood, but also crime rates, housing prices, reputation of public schools for the children, shops, malls, theatres, hospitals et cetera.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the scope of the project manageable, I will use two cities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    San Francisco: San Francisco is set to be the \"old\" home and serves as a starting point for the analysis\n",

    "#### Step 1: Define the characteristics of the neighborhoods in San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step I will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in San Francisco. I will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. To accomplish that task, the k-means clustering algorithm will be utilized. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in San Francisco and their emerging clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I will try to find the best \"fit\" between neighborhoods in San Francisco and Chicago. Therefore, I will do the same segmenting and clustering for the neighborhoods in San Francisco to find similarities between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Scoring of neighborhoods within Chicago to make a recommendation of the best places \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, various data sources like socio economic features will be utilized in the analysis of the neighborhoods in Chicago to give an overall picture.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The latest estimate for the population of Chicago, Illinois comes from the US Census Bureau. They confirmed that, in July 2011, there were 2,707,120 people living in the city of Chicago. The population has been estimated to be approximately 2.71 million, with slow growth and declines attributed to violence, tax increases and issues with schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This estimate is based on extrapolating the 2010 census data, which reported that the city was home to 2,695,598 people. The 2010 census showed a dramatic drop of almost 7% over the previous ten years, so if the Census Bureau's 2011 figures are correct, they would appear to show Chicago tentatively entering a new period of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2016 estimated population of 2.7 million makes Chicago the third largest city in the United States, behind New York City (8.55 million) and Los Angeles (3.97 million). Chicago is by far the largest city in Illinois, with the next largest city, Aurora, being under 200,000 people.\n",
