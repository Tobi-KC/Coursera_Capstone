# Coursera_Capstone
This capstone project course is part of IBM Data Science Certificate for Professional Qualification. That project is an assignment that gives a taste of what data scientists go through in real life when working with data.  It is about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. It makes use of how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. Also, it's about how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. Python and its pandas library will be utilized to manipulate data, which will help to refine my skills for exploring and analyzing data.
