    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Foursquare API__\n",
    "\n",
    "As requested by the assignment, this project will heavily use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source. With the API I will perform location search, location sharing and details about a business. Due to limitations of the API requests possible, the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find similarities between neighborhoods in San Francisco and Chicago, we need to gather data about different kind of  venues to find the characteristics. Hence, I will use Foursquare data for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the similarities of both cities, I will segment and cluster the neighborhoods to find similar places. In order to do that, a k-means clustering algorithm will be utilized, basen on location data provided by the Foursquare API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago__\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of the dataset can be found on [the city of Chicago's website](\n",
    "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2), but to summarize, the dataset has the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Community Area Number** (`ca`): Used to uniquely identify each row of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Community Area Name** (`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged Under** 18 or Over 64:Percent of population under 18 or over 64 years of age (`percent_aged_under_18_or_over_64`): (ie. dependents)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship. I will use the Hardship Index only as this score includes each of the indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "I acknowledge that the time series ends in the year of 2012, but for this assignment I will ignore this fact and assume that the data is up to date and still valid for this decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Chicago Public Schools - Progress Report Cards (2011-2012)__\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. The dataset is available from the Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I acknowledge that the time series ends in the year of 2012, but for this assignment I will ignore this fact and assume that the data is up to date and still valid for this decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Chicago Crime Data__  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is quite large - over 1.5GB in size with over 7 million rows. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:\n",
    "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__5. Home values - Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)__  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI)is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zillow publishes top-tier ZHVI (USD, typical value for homes within the 65th to 95th percentile range for a given region) and bottom-tier ZHVI (USD, typical value for homes that fall within the 5th to 35th percentile range for a given region). \n",
    "\n",
    "Zillow also publishes ZHVI for all single-family residences (USD, typical value for all single-family homes in a given region), for condo/coops (USD), for all homes with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5+ bedrooms (USD), and the ZHVI per square foot (USD, typical value of all homes per square foot calculated by taking the estimated home value for each home in a given region and dividing it by the home’s square footage). \n",
    "\n",
    "Check out https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ for an overview of ZHVI and a deep-dive into its methodology.\n",
